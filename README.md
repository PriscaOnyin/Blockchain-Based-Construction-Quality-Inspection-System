# Blockchain-Based-Construction-Quality-Inspection-System

## Overview
This project leverages blockchain technology and Clarity smart contracts to enhance transparency, automate quality inspections, and ensure secure payments in the construction industry. By integrating automated verification and immutable compliance records, stakeholders can track progress, reduce disputes, and improve efficiency.

## Features
- **Automated Inspection Tracking** – Stores inspection records on a tamper-proof blockchain.
- **Smart Payments** – Releases funds only when inspections are successfully completed.
- **Immutable Compliance Records** – Ensures all approvals are transparent and verifiable.
- **IoT & BIM Integration** – Enables real-time monitoring and validation.
- **Dispute Resolution** – Provides auditable logs to resolve conflicts.
- **Automated Alerts** – Notifies stakeholders about inspection updates.
- **Customizable Rules** – Supports different project types and compliance standards.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain:** Stacks Blockchain
- **Smart Contracts:** Clarity Language
- **Frontend:** React.js (Optional for UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Optional for API handling)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (For off-chain data storage, if needed)
- **IoT Integration:** Sensors & APIs (For real-time tracking)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm installed
- Clarity development environment setup
- Stacks Blockchain API access

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/blockchain-construction.git
   cd blockchain-construction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```sh
   clarinet test
   clarinet deploy
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Smart Contract Structure
- **`inspection.clar`** – Manages inspection records and verification.
- **`payment.clar`** – Handles conditional payments based on inspection status.
- **`compliance.clar`** – Ensures regulatory and safety standards are met.

## Usage
1. Register a construction project on the blockchain.
2. Assign inspectors and link IoT devices for automated validation.
3. When inspections pass, smart contracts trigger payment releases.
4. Stakeholders can audit the records for transparency.
